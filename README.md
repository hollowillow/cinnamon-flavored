# INTRODUCTION
Cinnamon Flavored is a personal hobby project modpack for me and my friends.
It is a modpack inspired in large part by the [Raspberry Flavored](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/raspberry-flavoured) modpack. modpack.
However, unlike RF it serves to offer a primarily multiplayer focused experienced, in a newer version of minecraft and with
more content for different kinds of players, in a more kitchensink approach rather than vanilla+.

You can download the latest stable release as a zipfile or mrpack in [releases](https://github.com/hollowillow/cinnamon-flavored/releases).
