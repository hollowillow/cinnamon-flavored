# INTRODUCTION
Cinnamon Flavored is a personal hobby project modpack for me and my friends.
It is a modpack inspired in large part by the [Raspberry Flavored](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/raspberry-flavoured) modpack. modpack.
However, unlike RF it serves to offer a primarily multiplayer focused experience,
with more content for different kinds of players, in a more kitchensink approach.

This modpack is designed for the Fabric mod loader on 1.20.1
You can download the latest stable release as a zipfile in [releases](https://github.com/hollowillow/cinnamon-flavored/releases).
